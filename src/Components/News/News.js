          Aeolus has developed a robust and portable ventilator for use in
          developing countries. Katie Stone, 22, won the Genesis Centre's Pitch
          and Pick competition with the Aeolus Portable Ventilation System, a
          prototype that will hopefully provide a cost-effective alternative to
          traditional COVID-19 ventilators. She said the project started as a
          capstone design project for her degree, along with work from partners
          Desiree Van Heerden and Rachel Tobin, but Stone decided to keep
          working on the project herself after graduation.
